40;"Redistribution/Rebalancing";"Investment component";"Process";"Operating, maintaining & upgrading";"Rebalancing bicycles across docking stations is the key process to the success of a bike-share system. During peak hours, users in cities where bike-share is used for commuting, take bikes from residential neighborhoods into office districts (downtown). As a result, stations in residential areas tend to be empty with no bikes available for subsequent riders, whereas stations in office districts (high foot-traffic areas) are full. Similarly, in areas with steep topography, uphill stations tend to be empty and ones located downhill tend to be full as users avoid wheeling bicycles on steep inclines. In order to maintain the supply of bicycles in places with high demand, bike-share systems deploy vehicles to collect bikes from high-volume stations and redistribute them to low-volume stations. Bicycles have RFID tags, which emit a signal when they get docked. The bike-share staff receives this data from all stations across the system and uses it to ascertain volumes at various stations in real-time. This data is used to plan and prioritize bicycle pick-up and drop-off locations. Rebalancing is also dne through differential pricing or incentives such as giving additional free ride-times for individuals docking bicycles in low-demand areas or up-hill neighborhoods.
