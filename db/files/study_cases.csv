It specified statutory control on the design of the building envelope of new commercial and hotel buildings by using the Overall Thermal Transfer Value (OTTV) method, applicable to warmer climactic conditions.
In 1998, four sets of energy efficiency codes of practice for design of building services, called ‘Building Energy Codes (BEC)’ were prepared and implemented on a voluntary basis. These codes covered lighting, air conditioning, power, and lift & escalator installations. The Electrical & Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) of the city launched the Hong Kong Energy Efficiency Registration Scheme for Buildings (HKEERSB) to promote the adoption of these codes. Buildings adopting the BECs were issued a certificate, however, this was discretionary .
In 2008, the Chief Executive of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region announced their intention to support a low carbon economy. The Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance (BEEO) was subsequently legislated as a major government measure for achieving this goal. The ordinance covers new construction and major retrofits of existing commercial buildings.";2010;"Urban energy";"New efficient constructions";"Whole city approaches"

Because of this, it sought to reduce its effect on the environment and lower the carbon footprint of its building sector by harnessing solar energy to provide solar thermal hot water.";"Since 1999, Barcelona has created targeted programs and schemes, regulations and legislations that have helped shaped Barcelona’s building efficiency outcomes for new constructions. In particular, Barcelona’s City Council passed the Solar Thermal Ordinance (STO) to harness their abundant solar energy resource for new buildings, making it the first city in Europe to have an STO. In 2002, the council established a target of reaching 96,300 square meters of solar collectors installed in the city, for an estimated thermal generation of some 778 gigawatt hours per year by 2010.";1999;"Urban energy";"New efficient constructions";"Whole city approaches"

One of the Region’s flagship projects – the “Exemplary Buildings” project, which calls for the construction and renovation of buildings meeting high-energy standards – saw the light of day in 2007. Starting 1st January 2015, all new buildings (housing, office, service buildings, or schools) were required to be up to the Passive Standard that is to say the level of “nearly zero or very low energy consumption reached thanks to high energy performance” (NZEB definition). To facilitate the implementation of this approach, the region developed the expertise and resources necessary to respond to the demand and supply aspects of sustainable buildings.";1999;"Urban energy";"New efficient constructions";"Whole city approaches"

As a result, it faces a considerable increase in demand of energy, which represents the second largest energy-consuming sector with a 34.7 percent of total consumption. Between years 2000-2006, about 750,000 buildings received construction permits, of which about 38 percent represented the non-residential sector (including hospitals, office, industrial, schools, etc.). The expectation is that the technological developments, energy efficiency, economic growth and improved living standards would result in an estimated increase of 9 percent of the national building stock until 2021.";"The Ministry of Environment and Urbanization of Turkey has taken the lead on implementing policies that helps reduce energy consumption in buildings, including for new constructions. In 2010, it released the National Climate Change Action Plan 2011-2021, which aims to reduce energy consumption of new buildings by 20 percent. In addition, the Ministry provided a set of regulations to improving thermal heat insulation, strengthening necessary infrastructure, and promoting use of renewable energy.

In 2009, Sweden’s ‘Integrated Climate and Energy Policy’ (ICEP) introduced the goal of increasing energy efficiency in buildings by 20% in 2020 and 50% in 2050. Supporting these ambitious targets, energy requirements in Sweden’s Building Code have been revised to become extremely rigorous for both new builds and building renovations.";"In addition to complying with national directives for energy efficiency in buildings, the City of Stockholm has created additional targets for building efficiency under its 2012-2015 Environment Program. The program encompasses six overarching quality registries that connect to the national environmental quality objectives. The quality registries are in turn broken down into concrete interim targets that describe how individual or joint municipal committees and/or boards are expected to contribute to the goals of their particular operations. Three of the six registries specify strategies for reducing emissions, increasing the energy efficiency, and climate-change resilience for new buildings.";2010;"Urban energy";"New efficient constructions";"Whole city approaches"

Menino and the Boston Redevelopment Authority formed a Green Building Task Force to study how green building practices could be encouraged in Boston. After a 12-month study, the Task Force recommended a set of initiatives. A change to the zoning code was one of the major recommendations offered by the task force.";"In January 2007, the city amended the Boston Zoning Code as per these recommendations to become the first city in the US to require a green building standard through municipal zoning requirements. Two articles, Article 80 (Development Review and Approval) and Article 37 (Green Buildings) of the Zoning Code deals with Green Buildings. Under the stipulation of this amendment, the City requires that all large-scale projects must meet the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED Certification Standards .
The City of Boston's 2007 Executive Order on Climate Action calls for the City to have a climate action plan that is updated every three years. The Climate Action Plan serves as Boston's blueprint for reaching its goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2020 and 80% by 2050.

Subsequent initiatives have included priority permitting, energy benchmarking and an updated policy for City buildings. Using its strong relationships with the City's water and energy utilities and their incentive programs, the City of Seattle connected developers, design teams and building permit applicants with green building resources and helped eliminate code-barriers to building green.

The Indian government has passed targeted legislation to promote energy efficiency in new buildings.";"In 2001, the Indian Parliament passed the Energy Conservation Act, under which the Ministry of Power set up the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). The BEE developed the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), launched by the Ministry of Power in 2007 as a first step towards promoting energy efficiency in the building sector . The Act requires all new buildings to follow the ECBC . Subsequently, several states in the country have modified their building codes to comply with the ECBC. In 2013, he DDA amended the Delhi Master Plan 2021 to make provisions for building incentives for new developments of 300 sq.m or above integrating specified green building/energy efficiency strategies.

It also aims to work towards setting industry standards on zero and net positive energy low-rise buildings and low energy high-rise buildings that address high density. Overall, the city’s goal is to make at least 80 percent of the buildings in the city energy efficiency (green) by 2030.
To encourage these developments, the BCA has established several incentives schemes that will allow the development of new greener buildings. For example, the Green Mark Gross Floor Area Incentive scheme is applicable to all new and existing private developments that undergo substantial energy efficiency enhancements. In return, it authorizes the developer to utilize additional floor area. In addition, the city has employed other investment incentives for construction of new high-performance buildings.";2014;"Urban energy";"New efficient constructions";"Whole city approaches"
